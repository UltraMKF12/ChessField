Menu is the last thing to develop.

1. Make an interface to have a way to connect the 
play menu and the game 4*4x4 tiles with units on them.

2. Make tiles ascend from below with the units.
The way this animation works is by resizing everything, anchored to the middle, 
to it looks good. (Or just use surfaces to make it easier)
Generate random units with it.

3. At the same time make sure the reverse is doable. 
Units that are falling disitengrate with shaders.

4. Draw borders around the board with thick purple outline.

5. Make turn system so the player has to move all or x amount of their units,
before automatically starting a new turn.
Units that are not moved will sway left and right, units that are moved will become gray.

6. Basic AI calculations, where for each enemy every tile that i can moved on gets a point.
If it can take down an enemy it gets 100 points, if its a position that gets you close to enemy
20 point, if its a position that will make the unit die its -50 points.
A system similar to this will enable a very simple AI. While it will have problems with bishops
it will be enough for a time. Implementing complex AI, where each unit has their own AI will,
will be the final challange of the game development.
