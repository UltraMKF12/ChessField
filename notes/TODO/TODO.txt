-The player can only move their own units.
-A round can be skipped by pressing ENTER.

Randomly 1-3 modules get added to the board with random unit composition of enemy and player.
Modules have a larger chance to include units from the same team.

In the players round there is a random chance for a module to fall after the round is over
This is indicated by a red overlay.
Empty tiles have bigger chance to fall.

After the player moves all units or skips turn, the other 2 teams start moving 1 unit per second
They use a basic ai, that simply looks at each avaliable move and check how close the unit will be
to another unit, and when its can take down a unit it does.

It does not calculate dangers, and does not think 2-3 turns in the future.

Fix:
The pawn should only be able to attack vertically.

EXTRA:
Shader that deletes sprite from direction, but right before deletion the edges that are about to be
deleted are yellow-orange-red colored, like the sprite is being burned.

Surface animation where units rise and fall, with basic dissolve shader.
