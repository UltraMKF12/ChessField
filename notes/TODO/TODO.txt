Randomly 1-3 modules get added to the board with random unit composition of enemy and player.
Modules have a larger chance to include units from the same team.

In the players round there is a random chance for a module to fall after the round is over
This is indicated by a red overlay.
Empty tiles have bigger chance to fall.

EXTRA:
Shader that deletes sprite from direction, but right before deletion the edges that are about to be
deleted are yellow-orange-red colored, like the sprite is being burned.

Surface animation where units rise and fall, with basic dissolve shader.
